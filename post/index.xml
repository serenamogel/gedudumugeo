GACKTさんの卒業式訪問&amp;amp;サプライズライブ。
非ファンの方からすると「？」と思われる行動かもしれません。
卒業式にサプライズで登場するアーティストは多くいますが、
毎年行うことはあり得ません。
ましては、そのサプライズ用の楽曲を持っているアーティストだって、
GACKTさん以外に知りません。
そもそも始めたきっかけ何なのか？そして、続ける理由とは何なのか・・・。GACKTさん本人の発言を参考に考えていみたいと思います。
GACKTが卒業式サプライズライブを続ける理由は自身の「エゴ」 昨年、GACKTさんがサプライズライブに向かう姿を、ネットで生中継されました。
中継の中でGACKTさんは、この数年間卒業式のサプライズを続ける理由に、自分の「エゴ」だと発言されました。
そして見事、このリスナーは自分たちの手で目標を達成し、ＧＡＣＫＴは約束通り卒業式に登場した。この経験で「ボクもまた多くのことを学ばせて貰った」というＧＡＣＫＴ。卒業式で大きな感動を贈ることで「彼らの背中を押すことが出来れば、きっとその中の誰かがいずれ１０年後２０年後に、また新たな若者達の背中を押せるような人物になってくれるんじゃないのか・・・」という思いが芽生えた。
卒業式ライブについてＧＡＣＫＴは「エゴ」と表現する。「エゴという言葉を使うのは、【ボクがやりたいからやってる】ということだからだ。誰かに褒められたいわけでも、誰かに認められたいからやってるわけでもない」との思いを明かした。引用元：https://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/news/1617427.html
気持ちがバトンとして継承されることを期待しながらも、結局は「やりたいからやってる」とハッキリ言われてます。
GACKTさんは、自分に少しでも影響力があるうちに・・・と語っていましたが、その言葉の裏にいつか来る限界を想像してるようで、ちょっと寂しくもなります。
大半のミュージシャンの影響力は永遠ではないですが、
GACKTさんは、生きてる限り影響力のある側のミュージシャンであって欲しいです。
影響力がある限りは続けると言われていますが、実際になくなる時期はいつになるのか？本当にずっと続けてくれるのか・・・。
初期の頃は何かと意味合いを兼ねてサプライズを行っていましたが、その後は学校側（先生or生徒）からのリクエストで訪問するパターンがほとんどです。
どこかの学校の先生か生徒が望む限り、それは影響力があると見だして良いのであれば、このサプライズは長く続くことが期待できます。
始めたきっかけ「GacktのFURACHIな男たち」2004.7.24放送 GACKTさんは２０００年代の半ばまでラジオの活動もされてました。デビュー当初の黄金時代から、その後のオールナイトニッポンまで、普段は知ることに出来ないGACKTさんの姿が見れるということで大人気でした。
当時のGACKTさんはメディアに出ても全然笑わなかったため、ラジオのCMでは「あのGACKTの笑い声が聞ける！」と宣伝されてました。。笑
「GacktのFURACHIな男たち」は３０分と短い番組の中で、GACKTさんがお悩み相談に答えるコーナーや、ちょっと子供が聞くべきではない内容までありました。
そんなラジオ番組の中で届いたお便りの１つが、今の卒業式サプライズに繋がっているのです。
運命のお便りを寄せたのは、兵庫県に住む高校２年生の「りょう」くんでした。
内容は以下の通りです。
「Gacktさんぼくの高校の危機を救ってください。
ぼくは兵庫県立舞子高校、環境防災科という日本でただ1つの、いや世界でただ1つしかない学科に通っています。環境防災科とはそのものずばり、災害や防災についての特別なカリキュラムが組まれている学科です。
しかし創設３年目にして、危機が訪れました。ことし４月の新入生はなんと定員割れだったのです。
確かにわかりにくい学科だとは思いますが、将来的にきっと社会に貢献できると思っています。
そのためには在校生のぼくたちがどんどんアピールしなければなりません。うちの学科をGacktさんのように魅力のある存在にするためには、どうしたらいいのでしょうか」
この内容に対してGACKTさんは、阪神淡路大震災の時に京都にいたエピソードを話し、仲間を亡くしてしまった話を交えながらも、りょうくんが通ってる高校の学科に感心していました。
GACKTさんはその学科にどのような生徒が通っているのか、なぜ定員割れしたと思うのか？りょうくんに質問しながら、親身なって相談を受けていました。
学科には３年生がおらず実績がなく、多くの親御さんが進学を怖がっているのが原因で、それを解決するのは、その学科を出た今後に仕事として成り立つかを証明していかなければいけないと。
高校生相手に酷な切り返しでしたが、GACKTさんのトーンは本気でりょうくんも本気でした。
「理想と現実を同一線上に置くことが大切」だと、厳しい話で終わりそうでしたが、話の最後で、GACKTさんがりょうくんにこんな話をします。
『ボクが応援するのは構わないが、それが本当にオマエたちにとって意味があるのか？そんなことをしても、一時的にその学科の人気が戻ってもまたすぐに定員割れを起こしてしまうだろう。』
『大切なことは、何故今この時代に、環境防災科が必要であるかをオマエたち自身が、これから進学に迷っている中学生やその親たちにどこまでアピールできるか、熱意を届けられるかだろう？とにかく動け。』
『もし、オマエたちの頑張りで、翌年の新入生の定員をオーバーすることがあれば、ボクがオマエの卒業式に花を添えてやる』
GACKTさんがりょうくんにしたこの約束こそが、「野に咲く花のように」の完成に繋がり、例年の卒業式サプライズに続いたのです。
ビッグサプライズは、式典終了後に用意されていた。体育館がざわめき始めた時、革のロングコートにサングラスと、全身黒でまとめたGacktが、横手から右手を挙げて登壇。卒業生、父母、来賓から一斉に「ウッソー！」「キャーッ！」と歓声が上がり、パニック状態になった。
Gacktがいきさつを説明した。「2年前、ここの生徒の1人が僕にメールをくれて、この学校のことを教えてくれました。その生徒が1年前から“卒業式に来て欲しい、応援して欲しい”とメッセージをくれて…。今日は約束を守りに来たぞ！」。
同校は02年に「環境防災科」を1クラス設置したが、わずか3年で定員割れの危機に陥った。なんとかしたいと考えた同科生徒が、Gacktが阪神淡路大震災時に京都に住み、友人も被災したことを知ってメールを送り続けていた。
熱意に突き動かされたGacktは、プレゼントも用意していた。「この参加を決めたのが3日前。2日前に曲ができ、徹夜で仕上げてきました」と新曲を紹介。ギター2人を従え「いつか見た夢の場所へたどり着くまであきらめないでまだ名もない花だけど決して負けず強く咲きたい」と歌い上げた。
Gacktさんも素敵ですが、当時高校生だったりょうくんの行動力も素晴らしいです。
実はGACKTさんが作ったものだけでなくて、
りょうくんの努力が発祥させたすべて（歴代のサプライズ）だったのかもしれません。
ちなみにGACKTさんは前日に学校でリハーサルするという徹底ぶり、さらには交通費もすべて自腹での訪問でした。もちろんノーギャラです。
サプライズの根源がこれだけしっかりしててブレないからこそ素敵なのです。
歴代の学校 兵庫県立舞子高等学校（2006年2月28日） 初めての卒業ライブは兵庫県の舞子高校です。
生徒との約束のために、Diabolosツアーのアジア公演を終えた後に、飛行機の中で急いで作曲したそう。
そうして完成した「野に咲く花のように」が、今後１０年以上も卒業式で歌われ続けるなんて、当時は誰も想像もしてなかったです。
曲のMVには、約束した生徒に向かって「約束は守ったからな」と言い残すシーンが使われています。
今後、何があっても、GACKTさんの卒業式サプライズの原点であり頂点でもあるのが舞子高校だと思います。
ちなみにその生徒はその後、GACKTさんのスタッフとして働いてます。
長崎県立長崎北陽台高等学校（2007年3月1日） １年後に再びサプライズをするとは誰も想像もしてませんでした。この時期のGACKTさんもDRUGパーティがありましたから。
テレビ番組「みんなのうた」の「野に咲く花のように」の放映に同校が協力してる縁で登場しました。
この年は曲の最初にサングラスを外していました。最後のサビで外す演出は、何度も試行錯誤してる中で誕生してるんですね！
このサプライズで体育館にいた可能性のあるOB（年度の卒業生ではない）はラグビー選手の村上大記さんと陸上選手の出岐雄大さんです。
茨城県立佐竹高等学校（2008年3月1日） こちらはMALICE MIZER時代からの親友Kamiさんの母校です。GACKTさんはkamiさんのドラムセットを学校に寄付するために訪問しました。
県立佐竹高校は、以前Gacktが在籍していたバンド、MALICE MIZER （マリスミゼル）のドラマーで、'99年にくも膜下出血のために他界したKamiさんの母校。その県立佐竹高校に、Kamiさんの両親からの依頼で、Kamiさんが生前に愛用していたドラム・セットをメッセージとともに届けるために、Gacktは卒業式に訪れた。引用元：https://www.</description></item><item><title>Adam Levine Net Worth 2024</title><link>/adam-levine-net-worth-2024-2.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/adam-levine-net-worth-2024-2.html</guid><description>Adam Levine, the charismatic frontman of the pop-rock band Maroon 5 and a former coach on NBC’s “The Voice,” has been a prominent figure in the music industry for over two decades.

Black-and-white (or, more accurately, silver-and-white) creates a mysterious dream state, a simpler world of form and gesture. Most people do not agree with me.
