As Rosa’s own interest in civil activism rose, Raymond discouraged her from actively participating in the Scottsboro Boys defense efforts due to the dangers involved.

She took a seat in the first of several rows designated for “colored” passengers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Montgomery City Code required that all public transportation be segregated and that bus drivers had the “powers of a police officer of the city while in actual charge of any bus for the purposes of carrying out the provisions” of the code. That meant drivers were required to provide separate but equal accommodations for white and Black passengers by assigning seats. A line roughly in the middle of a bus separated white passengers in the front from Black passengers in the back. When an African American passenger boarded the bus, they had to get on at the front to pay their fare, then get off and reboard the bus at the back door.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the bus Parks was riding continued on its route, it began to fill with white passengers. Eventually, the bus was full, and driver James F. Blake noticed that several white passengers were standing in the aisle. Blake stopped the bus and moved the sign separating the two sections back one row, asking four Black passengers to give up their seats. The city’s bus ordinance didn’t specifically give drivers the authority to demand a passenger to give up a seat to anyone, regardless of color. However, Montgomery bus drivers had adopted the custom of moving back the sign separating Black and white passengers and, if necessary, asking Black passengers to give up their seats to white passengers. If the Black passenger protested, the bus driver had the authority to refuse service and could call the police to have them removed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Three of the other Black passengers on the bus complied with the driver, but Parks refused and remained seated. Blake demanded, “Why don’t you stand up?” to which Parks replied, “I don’t think I should have to stand up.” He called the police and had her arrested. Parks <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2005/US/10/25/parks.greenhaw/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="later said of the incident" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">later said of the incident</a>: “When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination cover my body like a quilt on a winter night.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The police arrested Parks at the scene and charged her with violation of Chapter 6, Section 11, of the Montgomery City Code.

The evening that Parks was arrested, E.D. Nixon began forming plans to organize a boycott of Montgomery’s city buses. Members of the Black community were asked to stay off city buses on Monday, December 5, 1955—the day of Parks’ trial—in protest of her arrest. People were encouraged to stay home from work or school, take a cab, or walk to work. Ads were placed in local papers, and handbills were printed and distributed in Black neighborhoods.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In fact, Parks wasn’t the first to push back against segregated busing practices.

Zion Church in Montgomery to discuss strategies and determined that their boycott effort required a new organization and strong leadership. They formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), electing Montgomery newcomer <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> as minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. The MIA believed that Parks’ case provided an excellent opportunity to take further action to create real change.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Parks arrived at the courthouse for trial that morning with her attorney, Fred Gray, she was greeted by a bustling crowd of around 500 local supporters, who rooted her on. Following a 30-minute hearing, Parks was found guilty of violating a local ordinance and was fined $10, as well as a $4 court fee.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Inarguably the biggest event of the day, however, was what Parks’ trial had triggered. The city’s buses were, by and large, empty. Some people carpooled and others rode in Black-operated cabs, but most of the estimated 40,000 African American commuters living in the city at the time had opted to walk to work that day—some as far as 20 miles.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Due to the size and scope of, and loyalty to, the boycott, the effort continued for several months. The city of Montgomery had become a victorious eyesore, with dozens of public buses sitting idle, ultimately severely crippling finances for its transit company. With the boycott’s progress, however, came strong resistance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some segregationists retaliated with violence. Black churches were burned, and both King and Nixon’s homes were destroyed by bombings. Still, further attempts were made to end the boycott. The insurance was canceled for the city taxi system that African Americans used. Black citizens were also arrested for violating an antiquated law prohibiting boycotts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In response, members of the Black community took legal action. Armed with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/linda-brown data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Brown class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Brown</a> v.

Parks’ attorney, Fred Gray, filed the suit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 1956, the district court declared racial segregation laws, also known as “Jim Crow laws,” unconstitutional. The city of Montgomery appealed the court’s decision shortly thereafter, but on November 13, 1956, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/supreme-court-justices data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="U.S. Supreme Court" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">U.S. Supreme Court</a> upheld the lower court’s ruling, declaring segregation on public transport to be unconstitutional.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the transit company and downtown businesses suffering financial loss and the legal system ruling against them, the city of Montgomery had no choice but to lift its enforcement of segregation on public buses, and the boycott officially ended on December 20, 1956, after 381 days. The combination of legal action, backed by the unrelenting determination of the Black community, made the Montgomery Bus Boycott one of the largest and most successful mass movements against racial segregation in history.</p><h2 data-node-id=43 title="Life After the Bus Boycott" data-anchor-id=life-after-the-bus-boycott class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Life After the Bus Boycott</h2><img alt="a black and white photograph of rosa parks, in a dress and pearls, and martin luther king jr, wearing a suit, standing in the foreground, with many people seated at tables in the background behind them" title="Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. in August 1965" width=1024 height=726 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dr-martin-luther-king-stands-with-rosa-parks-at-dinner-news-photo-1696271589.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King attend a dinner given in her honor during Southern Christian Leadership Conference convention on August 10, 1965, in a previously segregated hotel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although she had become a symbol of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Civil Rights Movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Civil Rights Movement</a>, Parks suffered hardship in the months following her arrest in Montgomery and the subsequent boycott.
